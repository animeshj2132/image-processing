Low-Level Design (LLD) for Image Processing System
1. Introduction
This document outlines the low-level design (LLD) for an image processing system that facilitates the uploading of CSV files, validates their contents, processes images, and stores results in a MongoDB database. The system also integrates Swagger for API documentation and uses webhooks for status updates.

2. System Overview
The system is composed of several components that work together to handle file uploads, validate CSV contents, process images, and manage the status of processing requests.

4. Component Descriptions
Express Server

Role: Acts as the main server handling all incoming HTTP requests.
Function: Routes requests to appropriate controllers, serves the API documentation, and manages middleware.
CSV Upload Controller

Role: Manages the upload and validation of CSV files.
Function: Handles file upload, validates CSV headers and data, and triggers the image processing service.
Image Processing Service

Role: Processes images as per the URLs provided in the CSV.
Function: Downloads images, compresses them, and stores the compressed versions.
MongoDB Database

Role: Stores processing requests and their statuses.
Function: Persists data related to processing requests, including initial data, processing status, and results.
Swagger

Role: Provides API documentation.
Function: Generates and serves interactive API documentation.
Webhooks

Role: Notifies external systems about the status of processing requests.
Function: Sends status updates to a predefined URL whenever the status of a processing request changes.

5. Detailed Component Interactions
File Upload & Validation

The client uploads a CSV file.
The server validates the file format and contents.
If the file is valid, a new processing request is created in the database with status 'received'.
An initial webhook notification is sent.
Image Processing

The image processing service picks up the request and starts processing.
Each image URL in the CSV is downloaded and compressed.
The compressed images are stored and their URLs are updated in the processing request.
The processing status is updated to 'processing' and a webhook notification is sent.
Completion and Notification

Once all images are processed, the status of the request is updated to 'completed'.
A final webhook notification is sent with the results.

6. Database Schema
ProcessingRequest
requestId: Unique identifier for the request.
status: Current status of the request (received, processing, completed, error).
processedData: Array of processed data including original and compressed image URLs.
errorMessage: Error message if processing fails.
timestamps: Timestamps for request creation and updates.

7. API Endpoints
POST /upload

Description: Uploads a CSV file.
Request: Multipart/form-data with the CSV file.
Response: JSON with status and requestId.
GET /status/{requestId}

Description: Retrieves the status of a processing request.
Request: Path parameter with requestId.
Response: JSON with status, processedData, and errorMessage.

8. Error Handling
File Upload Errors: Handles cases where no file is uploaded, or the file format is invalid.
CSV Validation Errors: Handles cases where CSV headers do not match the expected format or required fields are missing.
Image Processing Errors: Captures and logs errors during image download and compression, updating the request status to 'error'.

9. Security Considerations
Authentication: Ensure endpoints are secured using appropriate authentication mechanisms.
Validation: Properly validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks.
Data Protection: Ensure sensitive data is encrypted and access to the database is controlled.

10. Deployment Considerations
Scalability: Design the system to handle increased loads by scaling horizontally.
Monitoring: Implement monitoring to track the performance and health of the system.
Backup: Ensure regular backups of the database to prevent data loss.

11. Conclusion
This LLD provides a detailed overview of the image processing system, describing the roles and functions of each component and their interactions. The design ensures efficient handling of file uploads, image processing, and status tracking, while maintaining robust error handling and security measures.
